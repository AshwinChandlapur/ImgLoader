\n• 1 cup whole wheat flour (chapatti atta)
\n• 1/2 teaspoon salt
\n• 1/2 cup water\n
\nFor Filling\n
\n• 2 cup grated mix cheese 
\n• 1/4 cup jalapeno (finely chopped, adjust to your taste)", 
            "directions":"\nMaking the Dough\n
\n• Mix flour, and salt, in a bowl add the water as needed to make soft dough. Knead the dough for about one minutes on a lightly greased surface to make soft, and pliable dough. Set aside for at least ten minutes.
\nMaking the Filling\n
\n• Cheese and Jalapeno pepper mix it well and divide in 6 equal parts and roll them. Set aside.\n
\nMaking the Parathas:\n
\n• Divide the dough into six equal parts and form into balls\n
\n• Roll dough ball into a 3 circle. Place a cheese ball in the center. Pull the edges of the dough to wrap it around the cheese filling. Repeat to make all six balls. Let the filled balls settle three to four minutes. Note, this help rolling the paratha.\n
\n• Meanwhile heat the heavy skillet on medium heat until moderately hot. To test, sprinkle water on the skillet. If the water sizzles right away, the skillet is ready.\n
\n• Press the filled ball lightly on dry whole wheat flour from both sides.\n
\n• Using a rolling pin, roll the balls lightly to make six-inch circles, keeping the sealed side of the balls on top. If the dough sticks to the rolling pin or rolling surface, lightly dust the parathas with dry flour.\n
\n• Place the paratha on the skillet. When the paratha start to change color, and begins to puff up, flip it over. You will notice some golden-brown spots.\n
\n• After a few seconds, flip the paratha and press with a spatula making sure the paratha is golden-brown on both sides. Repeat for the remaining parathas.\n
\n• Parathas can be kept unrefrigerated for up to two days wrapped in aluminum foil or in a covered container. For later use, parathas can be refrigerated for about a week. Re-heat using a skillet or oven.",
