A few years later, Sait turned up at an SS Music VJ hunt sporting a head of blue hair, and made some progress. Although he does not have pictures of his look from the time, as he owned a Nokia 6600 and documentation of personal style was obviously less of a fad then, he was clearly making an impression even at a young age. Now, just a few weeks ago, the very same Vishal tweeted the teaser of Sait‚Äôs upcoming film, Humble Politician Nograj, with a congratulatory message. Nograj is something of a pop - culture phenomenon today.A parody of the modern - day politician, he periodically appears on YouTube and Facebook Live, wearing his trademark sunglasses and thick moustache, spewing politically incorrect statements without a care in the world.But before he adopted the guise of Nograj on radio‚Äî and Asgar, and Chacko, among countless others‚Äî Sait‚Äô s voice had already been on the airwaves in Bahrain and Dubai.He landed his first job at a radio station in Bahrain saying he had prior experience, before proceeding to make a hash out of a 25 - minute link he was asked to do, and learning an important lesson in the process.\"In any profession, if you don‚Äôt learn it, you don‚Äôt earn it. So I started learning it.\"",

			"content": "In Bengaluru, Danish Sait needs no introduction. For years, Bengalureans have loved his voice and wit. Some time ago, they even got to hear another version of him ‚Äî Nograj, who is in no way similar to the real Danish. You‚Äôve hated him, but you‚Äôve loved him at the same time. And now all the Nograj fans in the house will get to watch him on the big screen, once the film Humble Politician Nograj releases.  \n\nThese days, Danish literally leads a double life, juggling between himself and Nograj, spending most of his time with the film's post production. Danish, the comedian had so much to talk about in a short Interview quoted that \"The film has no connection to any existing politician. This is a pure satirical take on the kind of politics that we already have amidst us. Nograj was a concept started way back during my RJ days when I did prank calls with a series of characters I created with different voices. Nograj was one of them. He would find himself in situations that needed a cop to solve it. Once the RCB happened to catch my show that had Nograj‚Äôs character. They wanted to put together a show that would connect the fans to the team. That‚Äôs when I came up with the character Mr Nags, a modified version of Nograj. The next thing was a film. I wanted to take the character to another extent and that‚Äôs how the idea of the film came up.",

Yet, for the multifaceted Danish Sait, who wears many hats as a radio host, emcee and TV presenter, his Sandalwood debut as an actor is an all-new experience. Danish is quite amused by the attention and adulation coming his way as the hero of Humble Politician Nograj. This is not the first time he is facing the camera, though. He has already done many television shows. In his first ever interview to City Express, Danish talks about how he gets assistance even with something as simple as putting on a pair of trousers. The film is now on its second schedule and the artist says the experience on the sets of his first Kannada flick is very odd. \"I have learnt that in India we worship the actor when the fact is there are seventy other people who make this actor look good,\" says Danish. \"He brings to life what is on paper, but honestly the actor is a minuscule part of the film. Be it the light man or the camera guy, the person who is recording sound outside or food caterer, there are people working in 25 other departments... we don‚Äôt appreciate them are they are simply mentioned as a passing comment. Everybody earns their place after much hard work but a handfull are privileged.\n\"Danish cites his first hand experiences on the sets of Humble Politician Nograj. \"We have a dress man, who has been working in the industry for the last 35 years, who I happened to meet on the first day of shoot. I had to get into a different trouser for the next shot and this man came running to me to help me take my trouser off. I looked at him and asked, ‚ÄòUncle, why would you want to do it,‚Äô and he answered, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs what we are expected to do‚Äô. Then there was another person waiting with the shoes I had to wear. I don‚Äôt know the culture of the movie industry nor do I know who the actors are who take help to wear their shoes but how can you be so lazy! Acting in front of the camera is like second home to me, I have experienced a level of popularity and am a better person for it... Having said that,  I am used to doing my own s@!#,\"",
