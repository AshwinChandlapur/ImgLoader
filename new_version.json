\n• Mix the flour, sooji, salt, and oil add water as needed to make a firm dough.\n
\n• knead the dough for about 1 minutes to make the dough smooth and pliable.\n
\n• Let the dough sit for at least 15 minutes.\n

\n• Heat the oil in a frying pan on medium heat. Test the heat by adding one cumin seed to the oil; if it cracks right away oil is ready.\n
\n• Add cumin seeds as cumin seeds crack, add green peas stir-fry for about 2 minutes.\n
\n• Add all the other ingredients, potatoes, coriander powder, red chili powder, garam masala, mango powder, salt and green chili. Stir-fry for about 2 minutes, potato filling should be moist not very dry.\n
\nMaking Taco Shells\n
\n• Knead the dough for few seconds. Divide the dough into 8 equal parts, and roll them into balls.\n
\n• Roll each dough ball into about 4-inch diameter. Prick each rolled up Taco with a fork in several places both sides, this will prevent Taco from puffing and make them crisp.\n
\n• Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium heat. The frying pan should have about 1 inch of oil. To check if the oil is ready, put a small piece of dough in the oil. The dough should sizzle and come up slowly.\n
\n• Place one rolled Taco in the frying pan and press with a skimmer, turn and fold in half. Doing this it will become taco shape. Do not press, between the fold there should be space to fill the potatoes filling. Gently do the next one same way do not over crowd the frying pan. Fry them until light golden brown on both sides. This should take about 2-3 minutes. Take the Taco out and place them on paper towels to absorb the excess oil. Repeat the process for remaining Taco.\n
\n• You can prepare the taco shells in advance and store them in air tight container.\n
\nAssembling the Tacos\n
\n• Fill the taco shell with potato filling (filling should be hot) and drizzle with chutney.",
