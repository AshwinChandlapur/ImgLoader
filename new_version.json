\nMaking Taco Shells\n
\n• Knead the dough for few seconds. Divide the dough into 8 equal parts, and roll them into balls.\n
\n• Roll each dough ball into about 4-inch diameter. Prick each rolled up Taco with a fork in several places both sides, this will prevent Taco from puffing and make them crisp.\n
\n• Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium heat. The frying pan should have about 1 inch of oil. To check if the oil is ready, put a small piece of dough in the oil. The dough should sizzle and come up slowly.\n
\n• Place one rolled Taco in the frying pan and press with a skimmer, turn and fold in half. Doing this it will become taco shape. Do not press, between the fold there should be space to fill the potatoes filling. Gently do the next one same way do not over crowd the frying pan. Fry them until light golden brown on both sides. This should take about 2-3 minutes. Take the Taco out and place them on paper towels to absorb the excess oil. Repeat the process for remaining Taco.\n
\n• You can prepare the taco shells in advance and store them in air tight container.\n
\nAssembling the Tacos\n

Notes: To test if the oil is the right temperature, place a small piece of dough into the oil; oil should sizzle but it should take about 30 seconds to rise the dough. If dough rises faster, oil is too hot; if dough just sits without rising, oil is not hot enough.\n
\n• Place the gulab Jamuns in the frying pan. Note: remember gulab jamuns will expand in about double the size, so give them enough space, and don’t over crowed them.\n
\n• It should take about 7 minutes to fry the gulab jamuns. While frying keep rolling the gulab jamuns so they are evenly browned. You can make gulab jamuns in different size and shapeFry until the gulab jamuns become brown.\n
\n• Let the gulab jamuns cool off for a few minutes before placing them in the hot syrup, not boiling.\n
\n• The gulab jamuns should sit in the syrup for at least 20 minutes prior to serving.",

Utensils to steam Dhokla

Covered pan large enough to hold round cake rack
Round cake-cooling rack
Round 9” cake pan",

Grease the cake pan and set aside.
Set the cake rack in the pan. Add water, just enough to touch the cake rack, and bring to a boil. This will be used to steam the dhokla.
When the water boils, turn down the heat to medium.
Add the ENO to the batter and beat the batter for a minute, batter will become airy and frothy. Quickly pour batter into a greased cake pan. Place the cake pan into the saucepan over the cake rack. Cover the pan. Steam for about 8 minutes on medium heat. Do not open the pen in between.
Check Dhokla with a knife. If the knife comes out clean, dhokla is ready. Turn off the heat and let it sit over the stem for 4-5 minutes covered.
Prepare the seasoning

Heat oil in a small pan over medium heat moderately. Add mustard seeds, and sesame seeds stir for 3-4 seconds, add green chili stir and curry leaves, stir for few seconds. Cover the pan and turn off the heat. Careful curry leaves will splatter.
First drizzle the hot water over dhokla this will keep the dhokla moist. Then drizzle the seasoning over.

1 cup mint leaves (Pudina)
2 to 4 green chilies (adjust to taste)
3 tablespoons tamarind paste (Imli)
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon black salt
1 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
1/4 teaspoon ginger powder
1/8 teaspoon asafetida (Hing)
1 tablespoon roasted cumin seed powder
1 tablespoon sugar (adjust to taste)
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
4 cups water (adjust to taste)
Puris:
1/4 cup All Purpose flour (Maida or Plain Flour)
3/4 cup fine Sooji (Semolina Flour)
1/2 cup water (as needed)", 
            "directions": "Pani (Spicy Water):
Blend everything except the water together to make a fine paste. While blending, add water as needed to blend.
Taste to adjust the green chilies as they can be mild or hot. Add more lemon juice, sugar, and salt as needed to your desired taste. Remember you will be adding more water to dilute so paste should be spicier. Strain the paste using water as needed.
After straining mix the paste with remaining water or adjusting to the taste.
The pani (water) will taste best if refrigerated for a day.
Puris:

Mix the flour and sooji. Add water as needed to make firm dough. Knead the dough until it is pliable. Cover the dough with a damp cloth for about ten minutes.
Damp two kitchen towels, spread one damp towel over a cookie sheet or plain surface, close to where you are going to fry the puris.
Divide the dough into about 60 small balls. Keep them under a damp cloth.
Start rolling each ball to about a 2-inch diameter circle. Place over a damp towel and cover with another damp towel. Do this for all 60 puris. TIP: Placing the puris between damp cloths helps the puris to puff evenly on all sides.
Heat the oil on medium high heat. Oil should be about 1 1/2 inch high in frying pan. To test the oil, put a little piece of dough in the oil. The oil is ready if the dough comes up right away and does not change color.
Start frying the puris, starting first with the puri you first rolled.
Put one puri in the oil and press lightly. When it puffs turn over and put another puri in the oil. Keep adding six to eight puris at a time. Fry the puris until they are golden-brown all around by turning a few times. You may adjust the heat as needed while frying.
Take the puris out and place over paper towel, so the excess oil is absorbed. TIP: When taking the puris out of the frying pan, make sure to tilt the skimmer so that the excess oil is drained before placing on the paper towel.
Fry all the puris. They should be crisp and puff like a ball.
How to Serve:

Pani puris are served by making a small hole in each puri. Fill the puris with boiled and chopped potatoes, or boiled chickpeas. Finish by filling each puri with the spicy pani (water). Enjoy!",
