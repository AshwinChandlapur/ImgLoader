			\nAs pressure cooker starts steaming turn the heat down to low medium and cook for about 15 minutes. 
		\nClose the heat and wait until steam has stopped before opening the pressure cooker. Chana should be soft and tender.
Drain the water and save it for later use, this water is high in protein and can be used for making the soup or dals.
\nHeat the oil in a sauce pan over medium high heat. Add the chana, stir for few seconds. Add ginger and green chili, coriander powder, saut√© for about 1 minutes.
\nAdd salt, black salt, red chili powder, and sugar, add tamarind pulp. Cook for 3-4 minutes over low heat. If needed use few spoons of water, Chana mix should be moist. Turn off the heat.
\nAssemble the Kala Chana Chaat, add chopped potatoes, tomatoes, and cucumber, drizzle the roasted cumin seeds powder and mix it well. If desired garnish with sliced ginger, green chilies and drizzle the lemon juice.",
