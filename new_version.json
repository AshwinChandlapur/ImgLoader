   \n• Idli batter - 1/2 cup and a little more
   \n•  Green chilli - 1-2 minced
   \n• Ginger - 1 inch piece minced
   \n• Oil for making uttappams (sesame seed oil preferable)
", 
            "directions": "In a bowl combine onion, green chilli and ginger. Sprinkle a little salt and mix it. Remember the dosa batter has salt in it already. Keep this ready before heating the dosa tawa.
\n• Heat a tawa, add a drop of oil and rub it with half an onion. This will help you to take the dosa from the tawa easily.
\n• Once the tawa is heated well, reduce the heat to medium, pour a ladle of batter and spread it in a circular motion to form a thick dosa as shown in the picture. Do not spread it thin. Uthappams should be thick.
\n• After a minute, sprinkle the onion mixture all over the dosa. Be generous in adding onions for the uthappam to taste great. Gently press it with the dosa ladle or spatula.
\n• Drizzle a tsp of oil around the dosa. Once the the base is golden brown and you see lot of holes on the top, flip the dosa to the other side.
\n• Drizzle a little oil on the other side also. Let it cook the other side. Once it is cooked, remove the dosa from the tawa and serve hot with chutney or sambar.
\n• Note - You can sprinkle idli podi after you sprinkle onions for added taste and flavor.
\n•Another variation -You can mix the onions, green chilli and ginger with the batter and make dosa. Both methods work fine.",

        \n•Hot water is always preferred than room temperature water for making the dough. This will give you soft chapattis all the time.
        \n•Do not pour all the water at a time. Pour in little by little mixing.
        \n•Adding oil to the dough will give a good texture.
        \n•Knead the dough well for 2-3 minutes.
        \n•After kneading the dough, spread a little oil all over and let it sit for 15-30 minutes covered.
        \n•Roll out the dough evenly. Do not make it very thin, it won’t puff up well.
        \n•The pan should be really hot while adding the chappathi. Then after flipping it reduce heat to medium and after last flip increase heat to high for chapati to put up well. There are two flips in total. Check the directions.
        \n•After cooking the chapathis, it is best to eat them right away, or else just keep them closed in a thermal container.\n"
