Utensils to steam Dhokla

\n• Dhokla maker – or, if you don’t have that, use all three of the following: that’s what I am also using

\n• Covered pan large enough to hold round cake rack
\n• Round cake-cooling rack
\n• Round 9” cake pan",

Add all the ingredients except the ENO to the batter sooji, salt, sugar, asafetida, ginger, citric acid and green chili, mix it well, if needed add little more water. Set aside. We will add the ENO just before steaming.\n
\n• Grease the cake pan and set aside.\n
\n• Set the cake rack in the pan. Add water, just enough to touch the cake rack, and bring to a boil. This will be used to steam the dhokla.\n
\n• When the water boils, turn down the heat to medium.\n
\n• Add the ENO to the batter and beat the batter for a minute, batter will become airy and frothy. Quickly pour batter into a greased cake pan. Place the cake pan into the saucepan over the cake rack. Cover the pan. Steam for about 8 minutes on medium heat. Do not open the pen in between.\n
\n• Check Dhokla with a knife. If the knife comes out clean, dhokla is ready. Turn off the heat and let it sit over the stem for 4-5 minutes covered.\n
Prepare the seasoning

\n• Heat oil in a small pan over medium heat moderately. Add mustard seeds, and sesame seeds stir for 3-4 seconds, add green chili stir and curry leaves, stir for few seconds. Cover the pan and turn off the heat. Careful curry leaves will splatter.
\n• First drizzle the hot water over dhokla this will keep the dhokla moist. Then drizzle the seasoning over.
\n• Cut them in squares.
\n• Serve with Hari cilantro chutney. Taste best when it is served warm.",

\n• Taste to adjust the green chilies as they can be mild or hot. Add more lemon juice, sugar, and salt as needed to your desired taste. Remember you will be adding more water to dilute so paste should be spicier. Strain the paste using water as needed.\n
\n• After straining mix the paste with remaining water or adjusting to the taste.\n
\n• The pani (water) will taste best if refrigerated for a day.\n
Puris:

\n• Mix the flour and sooji. Add water as needed to make firm dough. Knead the dough until it is pliable. Cover the dough with a damp cloth for about ten minutes.\n
\n• Damp two kitchen towels, spread one damp towel over a cookie sheet or plain surface, close to where you are going to fry the puris.\n
\n• Divide the dough into about 60 small balls. Keep them under a damp cloth.\n
\n• Start rolling each ball to about a 2-inch diameter circle. Place over a damp towel and cover with another damp towel. Do this for all 60 puris. TIP: Placing the puris between damp cloths helps the puris to puff evenly on all sides.\n
\n• Heat the oil on medium high heat. Oil should be about 1 1/2 inch high in frying pan. To test the oil, put a little piece of dough in the oil. The oil is ready if the dough comes up right away and does not change color.\n
\n• Start frying the puris, starting first with the puri you first rolled.\n
\n• Put one puri in the oil and press lightly. When it puffs turn over and put another puri in the oil. Keep adding six to eight puris at a time. Fry the puris until they are golden-brown all around by turning a few times. You may adjust the heat as needed while frying.\n
\n• Take the puris out and place over paper towel, so the excess oil is absorbed. TIP: When taking the puris out of the frying pan, make sure to tilt the skimmer so that the excess oil is drained before placing on the paper towel.\n
\n• Fry all the puris. They should be crisp and puff like a ball.\n
How to Serve:

\n• Pani puris are served by making a small hole in each puri. Fill the puris with boiled and chopped potatoes, or boiled chickpeas. Finish by filling each puri with the spicy pani (water). Enjoy!",

\n• Turn off the heat. Let the mixture cool off.\n
To make the Kachoris

\n• Take the dough and knead it for a minutes. Divide the dough in twelve equal parts.\n
\n• Take one part of the dough and with your fingers flatten the edges and make into 3-inch circle. Leaving center little thicker than edges.\n
\n• Mold the dough into a cup and place about 2 teaspoons of filling in the center. Pull the edges of the dough to wrap the dal filling. Proceed to make all 12 balls.\n
\n• Let the filled ball sit for three to four minutes before rolling.\n
\n• Set the kachoris on a surface with the seams facing up. Roll it slowly about three inches in diameter.\n
\n• Heat the oil in frying pan over medium heat frying pan should have about one inch of oil. To check if oil is ready put a little piece of dough in the oil. Dough should sizzle, and come up very slow.\n
\n• Fry them on medium-low heat. After they start to puff, slowly turn them over. Fry until golden-brown on both sides. This should take about five minutes. If the kachoris are fried on high heat, they will get soft and will not be crispy.\n
\n• Kachories can be stored for at least a week in an airtight container.\n
\n• If kachories get soft warm up the kachoris in an oven on 200 degree F for about 7 to 10 minutes, this will bring back the freshness and crispyness.\n

Serving suggestion: serve them plain, or with tamarind chutney and yogurt as chaat, or serve the kachories as main meal and serve them with aloo dum",

\n• Boil the milk in a heavy bottomed over medium-high heat, stirring frequently making sure milk do not burn on the bottom of the pan.\n
\n• As the milk comes to a boil, add the lemon juice slowly and stir the milk gently. The curd will start separating from the whey, turn off the heat.\n
\n• Once the milk fat has separated from the whey, drain the whey using a strainer line with cheesecloth or muslin cloth.\n
\n• Wrap the curd in a muslin cloth, rince under cold water, and squeeze well. This process takes out the sourness from the lemon.\n
\n• To take out the excess water squeeze the cloth, or press the wrapped paneer under a heavy pan for about one hour. Taking the right amount of water out of the paneer is the most important part of this recipe.\n
\n• To check if enough water is out of the paneer, take a little piece of paneer on your palm and rub with your fingers. After rubbing the paneer for about 15-20 seconds, you should be able to make a firm but smooth ball.\n
\n• If the paneer is too dry, add a few drops of water, using the water squeezed from the paneer.\n
\n• Once the paneer is drained, place on a dry, clean surface and knead the paneer for 3-4 minutes until the paneer is almost rolls into smooth soft dough.\n
\n• Knead the paneer by dragging the palm of your hand hard on the paneer. Keep scooping it back to togather and knead more. Your palm will be little greasy.\n
Making the Rasmalai:

\n• Divide the dough into 12 equal parts and roll them in smooth balls.\n
\n• To make the balls apply some prassure at the first and then release when forming the balls, lightly press to make about 3/4″ patty shape.\n
\n• Mix the sugar and water in a pressure cooker on medium high heat and bring to a boil.\n
\n• Add the paneer balls and close the pressure cooker. After the pressure cooker starts steaming, turn the heat to medium and cook for about seven minutes.\n
\n• Make sure the cooker is large enough to accommodate the finished rasgullas patties, as they will expand to about double in the volume while cooking in the syrup!\n
\n• Close the heat and wait a few minutes befor opening the pressure cooker. Pour cold water over the cooker before opening.\n
\n• Take out the patties from the syrup and squeeze them lightly,and keep aside.\n
\n• Boil the milk in a frying pan on medium heat until the milk reduce to about 2 cups.\n
