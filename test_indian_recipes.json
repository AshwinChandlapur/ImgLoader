\n• Since this is a dry filling/sabji, the dosa should not be too thin like masala dosa. It should be thicker than the normal dosa and a little thinner than uthappam.\n
\n• Now let us see how to make dosa with paneer filling-\n
\n• Heat a tawa, pour a ladle of dosa batter, spread it in a circular motion.\n
\n• As it gets cooked, holes start appearing. Drizzle a tsp of oil around the dosa.\n
\n• Once the sides of the dosa starts to lift up, flip it over to the other side. Let the other side get cooked. After it is cooked, flip again, place 2-3 tbsp of paneer filling and fold the dosa.\n
\n• Serve hot with sambar or chutney.

\n• Once it cools, add ragi flour to the vegetables and mix well. Add little salt as we have already added salt to the vegetables. Add water little at a time and make a dough.\n
\n• Divide the dough into 6 equal sized balls. Grease a plantain leaf or a ziplock bag with oil and flatten the ragi dough ball with your fingers.\n
\n• Grease the tawa and heat it. Transfer the flattened dough to the tawa. If you have used plastic sheet, transfer to your hands first and then place it on the tawa. You can flatten the dough directly on the tawa also. If you are flattening the adai directly on the tawa, switch off the flame, flatten it and switch on again to prevent your hands from getting scorched.\n
\n• The dough will start changing color. Drizzle oil around the adai and cook both sides well on medium heat.\n
 \n• Repeat the same process for the rest of the dough.\n
\n• Ragi adai should be served hot from the tawa. You can have any chutney or sambar as side dish for this adai.
